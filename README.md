# Post-Quantum Cryptography Performance Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project benchmarks classical cryptographic algorithms (RSA, ECC) against standardized and emerging Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms like Kyber, Dilithium, and Falcon.  
Itâ€™s divided into three phases:
1. **Replicate** existing benchmarks to learn the process.  
2. **Benchmark** new or less-explored PQC algorithms.  
3. **Analyze trends** and visualize how performance and security characteristics are changing over time.
